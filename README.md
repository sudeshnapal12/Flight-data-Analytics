# Visualization-lab2--Flight-data-Analytics
### Practice the three basic tasks of visual data analytics
* use data from mini project #1 (or other), begin with |N|≥500, |D|≥10)
* client-server system: python for processing (server), D3 for VIS (client)
### Task1: data clustering and decimation (30 points)
* implement random sampling and stratified sampling
* the latter includes the need for k-means clustering (optimize k using elbow)
### Task 2: dimension reduction (use decimated data) (30 points)
* find the intrinsic dimensionality of the data using PCA
* produce scree plot visualization and mark the intrinsic dimensionality
* obtain the three attributes with highest PCA loadings
### Task 3: visualization (use dimension reduced data) (40 points)
* visualize data projected into the top two PCA vectors via 2D scatterplot
* visualize data via MDS (Euclidian & correlation distance) in 2D scatterplots
* visualize scatterplot matrix of the three highest PCA loaded attributes

# Visualization Lab 3 - Volume Rendering
### Also added the renderings with ImageVis software.
* Renderings_with_imagevis_task_3 folder
